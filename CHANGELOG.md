## [1.0.38] — 2026-07-20

**Added x402 (USDC on Polygon) as a second payment rail, then removed the original direct-POL-transfer rail entirely — ported from `personal-sys-vps-private` (kro.uxprojects-jok.com), where it was built, live-tested with real USDC payments on Polygon mainnet, and subsequently used to fully replace the POL rail this same development cycle.**

x402 (Linux Foundation, standards-based) lets an autonomous AI agent pay for Soul access without any SYS-specific tooling: a 402 challenge with a `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` header, answered by a signed EIP-3009 `transferWithAuthorization` retry. Settlement runs through Polygon's own production x402 facilitator (`x402.polygon.technology`) — no account or API key needed, and SYS never holds a spendable private key server-side (same "verify, never send" model as the original POL flow's on-chain-tx verification). This was chosen over Coinbase's CDP facilitator after a broken AgentConnect-based wallet-pairing flow (see below) made the case for the simplest possible integration.

The direct POL-transfer rail (`soul_pay.lua`, `soul_pay_read.mjs`) is removed rather than kept alongside x402 — historical POL earnings/access-token records are retained (`earnings.json`, token type labels), only the *payment path* is gone. Node operators on an older POL-only soul: existing PayPal access and historical earnings are unaffected; `amortization.pol_per_request` is superseded by `amortization.price_usdc` — re-configure pricing in the Marketplace after updating.

**Breaking:** `POST /api/soul/pay` (direct POL transfer) no longer exists. `soul_pay_read` (MCP tool) is removed — a generic x402 client needs no SYS-specific payment tool.

**Added**
- `lua/soul_pay_x402.lua`: the x402 payment endpoint (`POST /api/soul/pay/x402`) — computes price fresh at both the 402-challenge and the signed-retry step (no price-quote/TTL system needed, unlike the old POL flow — x402's signature-then-facilitator-settle model closes the on-chain-confirmation timing gap that quotes existed to bridge), verifies the signed authorization server-side against the same core fields (amount, recipient, chain, asset, expiry) before trusting the facilitator's result, then delegates verify+settle to the Polygon facilitator.
- `lua/soul_price.lua`: rewritten from a POL-specific price+quote-lock endpoint into a currency-agnostic pricing-*factors* endpoint (anchor/age/demand multiplier only), used solely for the Marketplace live-preview UI.
- `lua/x402_agent_status.lua`, `x402_agent_key.lua`, `x402_agent_balances.lua`, `x402_agent_pay.lua` + `soul-mcp/lib/x402_agent_wallet.mjs`, `x402_client.mjs`: an *operator's own* x402 test wallet (Settings → x402 tab) — lets the node operator hold a small USDC/POL balance and send real x402 payments for testing, independent of the soul's own payment-receiving path. Uses `@x402/evm` + `viem` for direct private-key signing.
- `soul-mcp/server.mjs`: `POST /internal/verify-x402` (defense-in-depth checks before trusting the facilitator) and the `/internal/x402-agent/*` endpoints backing the Settings tab above.
- `amortization.price_usdc` field (Marketplace UI, `soul_amortization.lua`, `soul_register.lua`/`soul_register_preview.lua`, `soul_preview.lua`, discovery index) replacing `pol_per_request` throughout — same dynamic-pricing formula, now denominated in USDC at 6-decimal precision (was 4, matching POL's precision needs; USDC's atomic unit is 1e-6).
- EU withdrawal-rights consent flow (`show_withdrawal_terms`/`accept_digital_content_terms`, plus their REST twins): `payment_method` now `"paypal" | "x402"` (was `"paypal" | "pol" | "x402"`).

**Removed**
- `lua/soul_pay.lua`, `soul-mcp/tools/soul_pay_read.mjs`.
- POL-specific UI (Marketplace "Base amount per access (in POL)" field and live-price box), i18n strings, and legal-text (`agb.vue`/`agb.txt`) sections — all now describe x402/USDC or PayPal only. Old POL access tokens still display with a "(legacy)" label rather than being hidden.

**Fixed**
- `soul-mcp/tools/soul_paid_comment.mjs`, `soul_read_by_token.mjs`, `soul-mcp/prompts/index.mjs` (MCP system-prompt tool reference): description text, Zod field docs, 401 error messages, and the tool-reference table all pointed at the removed `soul_pay_read` tool — updated to describe paying `pay_endpoint` via x402 directly.
- `llms.txt` generator (`soul-mcp/server.mjs`) and the RFC 8707 Protected Resource Metadata endpoints (`/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource[/mcp]`, `unauthorized()` 401 body): payment hints now describe the x402 flow instead of a POL wallet transfer.

**Not ported**: the `sys-agent-x402.sh` wrapper (lets the SYS Agent Runner spend from the operator's test wallet through a narrow allowlist) and its `init.sh` installation step — both depend on `init.sh`, which doesn't exist in this repo yet. The core payment rail and the operator's manual Settings-tab test wallet work independently of this.

## [1.0.33] — 2026-07-19

**Added: `soul_draw` and `soul_generate` — two creative tools giving a soul (e.g. a personal AI identity) autonomous headless drawing and high-quality AI image/video generation, ported from `personal-sys-vps-private` (kro.uxprojects-jok.com) where they were built and live-verified across several iterations.**

These were built entirely in the private repo this development cycle and never ported until now — `soul_draw.mjs` didn't exist here at all. Porting `soul_generate` without it would have been incomplete: it shares `lib/artwork_log.mjs`'s progress-logging helper and is designed to sequentially refine a `soul_draw` sketch into a higher-quality piece using the same `canvas_id`.

**Added**
- `soul-mcp/tools/soul_draw.mjs`: headless vector/raster drawing from brush-stroke lists (Catmull-Rom interpolation + taper envelope from a handful of control points). Persistent across sessions via `canvas_id` — PNG preview in `vault_shared`, protected SVG vector source in `vault/context` (encrypted, not reachable via peer-sharing). Each call logs progress into `sys.md`'s "## Kunstwerke" section with a content hash, feeding into the existing blockchain-anchor mechanism.
- `soul-mcp/tools/soul_generate.mjs`: WaveSpeed AI image/video generation as a second creative tool. `text-to-image` and `edit-multi` (refines an existing `{canvas_id}.png`, previous stage auto-archived) run synchronously. `image-to-video` runs asynchronously across multiple calls instead — video generation commonly takes 1–5 minutes, too long for a single synchronous call; the first call submits and returns immediately, later calls with the same `canvas_id` do a single non-looping status check until the result is ready. A required `decision` field on every call documents *why* the generation happened, not just *what* — keeps the soul as author, the AI model as tool. Daily rate limit against runaway cost (image modes count on success, video counts on submission, since that's when the cost is committed).
- `soul-mcp/lib/artwork_log.mjs`: shared `sys.md` progress-logging helper used by both tools (`contentHash` is optional, for steps like "video generation started" that have nothing to hash yet).
- `soul-mcp/package.json`: added `@napi-rs/canvas` dependency (raster + SVG canvas rendering, shared 2D API).
- `soul-mcp/tools/vault_shared_list.mjs`: recognizes `{canvas_id}.svg`/`.png`/`.mp4` (no timestamp prefix) as distinct "Canvas" types, separate from one-off uploads — lets a soul rediscover and continue an existing work instead of accidentally duplicating it. Exports `formatVaultSharedList`/`listVaultSharedFs` for reuse by the in-app-chat path.
- `soul-mcp/tools/vault_shared_get.mjs`: images and SVGs now return real content (image content blocks for raster, readable text for SVG source) instead of just a URL.
- `lua/vault_shared_view.lua`/`lua/vault_shared_mcp_get.lua`: added `image/svg+xml` MIME support.
- `server/openresty/vhost.conf.template`: `/api/soul-tool`'s `proxy_read_timeout` raised from 30s to 120s — needed for `soul_generate`'s WaveSpeed polling, which can legitimately take 45–90s depending on mode.
- Wired into both tool registries (MCP `registerTools()` in `soul-mcp/tools/index.mjs`, in-app chat `/internal/run-tool` in `soul-mcp/server.mjs`, chat tool-schema mirror in `app/composables/useClaude.js`).

**Notes**
- Both tools are owner-only by design (not wired into `registerPaidTools()`/`registerPeerTools()`).
- The underlying design/philosophy document (why these tools require a documented decision rather than raw prompt passthrough) lives in the originating node's own vault content, not in this repo — node-specific, not code.

## [1.0.32] — 2026-07-19

**Fixed: found the actual root cause of the `beme_chat` empty-completion bug fixed in v1.0.31 — the model was consuming its entire `max_tokens` budget on invisible extended-thinking tokens before generating any visible text, for demanding prompts under a tight token budget.**

v1.0.31's diagnostic logging (`ngx.WARN`) turned out to never actually reach the log file on the reference deployment — `error_log` configured without an explicit level defaults to `error`, and `ngx.WARN` sits below that threshold. Bumped to `ngx.ERR`. With logging actually working, reproduced the bug with a demanding prompt + tight `max_tokens` and got the real answer from the log: the model spent the entire output budget on an extended-thinking block and never emitted a `text` block. Confirmed directly against the Anthropic API that `claude-sonnet-4-6` uses extended thinking even when it isn't requested.

**Fixed**
- `lua/beme.lua`: logging bumped from `ngx.WARN` to `ngx.ERR`; added `max_tokens` and `usage.output_tokens` to the log line for faster diagnosis.
- `lua/beme.lua`: the Anthropic request now sends `thinking: {type: "disabled"}` explicitly. Verified against the Anthropic API for both allowed models (`claude-sonnet-4-6`, `claude-sonnet-5`) — both accept the param and return real text instead of consuming the budget on thinking.

**Notes**
- Found and fixed on `personal-sys-vps-private` (kro.uxprojects-jok.com) v1.0.46, where it was verified live against a real soul and directly against the Anthropic API. Ported here unchanged — generic infrastructure, not node-specific content. If your `error_log` directive already specifies `warn` or lower, the `ngx.WARN`→`ngx.ERR` part of this fix wasn't affecting you, but the `thinking:disabled` fix still applies.

## [1.0.31] — 2026-07-19

**Fixed: `beme_chat` could return a blank/void response instead of a real answer — not a transport or auth error, but Anthropic occasionally returning HTTP 200 with no usable text content, which `beme.lua` silently forwarded as `{response:""}`.**

There was zero logging of *why* this happened — no `stop_reason`, no content-block breakdown — so it was previously undiagnosable when it occurred.

**Fixed**
- `lua/beme.lua`: when the extracted `response_text` is empty despite a 200 from Anthropic, no longer silently returns `{response:""}`. Now logs `stop_reason` and the response's content-block types to the OpenResty error log, and returns a proper `502 {"error":"empty_completion","message":"..."}` instead — surfaces as an actionable error rather than a confusing blank reply.
- `soul-mcp/tools/beme_chat.mjs`: catch block now unwraps a 502's JSON body (when present) to show the real `message` instead of the raw `SYS API 502: {...}` dump.

**Notes**
- Root cause of *why* Anthropic returns an empty completion for a given message is still open — this fix doesn't prevent it, it makes it diagnosable (via the new log line) and turns it into a clear error instead of a silent blank one.
- Found and fixed on `personal-sys-vps-private` (kro.uxprojects-jok.com) v1.0.44, where it was live-verified against a real soul (confirmed via `nginx` access-log response sizes before/after). Ported here unchanged since `beme.lua`/`beme_chat.mjs` are generic infrastructure, not node-specific content.

## [1.0.30] — 2026-07-19

**Added: `.json` is now a full context-document type (visible, uploadable/syncable, AI-readable) — previously excluded at every layer of the vault stack, both client and server.**

`.json` was explicitly excluded at 8 independent spots across the client and server: `useVault.js`'s local folder scan (both memory-mode and File-System-Access-API mode) skipped `.json` when building the file list, `useApiContext.js`'s `fileTypeFromPath()` returned `null` for any `.json` extension ("Metadaten/Config-Dateien niemals syncen"), the Vault Explorer's file-picker `accept` attribute and its `MEDIA_EXTS` archive filter both omitted `.json`, and server-side `vault_sync.lua`'s upload whitelist, `context_write.mjs`'s filename regex, `api_context.lua`'s auto-registration scan, and two peer/public-sharing `file_type_of()` helpers (`vault_connections_peer.lua`, `vault_public.lua`) all only recognized `md`/`txt`/`pdf`.

The exclusion made sense historically (guarding against internal config files like `api_context.json`/`config.json` accidentally being treated as vault content), but was too broad — it also blocked any legitimate structured-data document a node operator or the AI itself wanted to keep in `vault/context/`.

**Added**
- `.json` recognized as a `context`-type document everywhere `.md`/`.txt`/`.pdf` already were: local vault scan (`useVault.js`), sync-type mapping (`useApiContext.js`), file-picker `accept` + archive filter (`VaultExplorer.vue`), upload whitelist (`vault_sync.lua`), MCP `context_write`/`context_get`/`context_list` (regex + descriptions), auto-registration scan (`api_context.lua`), peer/public sharing type detection and inline-text serving (`vault_connections_peer.lua`, `vault_public.lua`), and the `application/json` MIME type (`api_serve.lua`, `vault_public.lua`).

**Notes**
- Two known companion files, `voice_profile.json` and `motion_profile.json` (written by `VoiceRecorder.vue`/`AudioCaptureCard.vue`/`MotionCaptureCard.vue`/`MotionRecorder.vue` under `voice_samples/`/`motion_samples/`), stay explicitly excluded by exact basename from context-document treatment — they're recorder-internal embedding data, not user documents.
- Found and verified live on `personal-sys-vps-private` (kro.uxprojects-jok.com); ported here unchanged since this is generic vault-stack infrastructure, not node-specific content. `npx nuxt generate` confirmed clean on this repo after applying the patch; the private-repo live test (`context_write` → `context_get` → `context_list` against a real soul) is documented in that repo's own CHANGELOG (v1.0.43).

## [1.0.29] — 2026-07-18

**Fixed: branding files (`logo.png`, `logo.ico`, `favicon.ico`, `manifest.json`, the PWA icons) were served with a 1-year `immutable` cache — the same rule correctly applied to Nuxt's content-hashed `/_nuxt/*` bundle assets, but these branding files keep the same URL forever even when their content changes. A returning visitor who'd loaded the site before a logo swap kept seeing the old logo for up to a year, even though the server was already serving the new one correctly.**

**Fixed**
- `server/openresty/vhost.conf.template`: added a location block for `logo.png`/`logo.ico`/`favicon.ico`/`manifest.json`/`icons/icon-192.png`/`icons/icon-512.png`, matched *before* the broad long-cache regex (nginx evaluates regex locations in file order, first match wins), giving them `max-age=300, must-revalidate` instead of the 1-year immutable default. The broad rule itself is untouched and still correctly applies `immutable` caching to genuinely content-hashed bundle files.
- `public/sw.js`: cache version bumped (`sys-shell-v12` → `v13`) as an additional safety net for any already-installed service worker.

**Notes**
- This bug was latent since the branding system was introduced (v1.0.24) — it never surfaced until a node operator actually swapped a logo file after already having visited the live site. Found and verified live on `personal-sys-vps-private` (kro.uxprojects-jok.com), ported here unchanged since the caching rule is generic infrastructure, not node-specific content.

## [1.0.28] — 2026-07-18

**Fixed: `utils/generate-icons.mjs`'s maskable-icon padding color was hardcoded to `manifest.json`'s `background_color`, which can visibly mismatch a logo's actual background — produces a faint but visible border/frame around the generated PWA icon.**

**Fixed**
- `utils/generate-icons.mjs`: now samples the source `logo.png`'s own corner pixel color at generation time and uses that as the padding color, instead of assuming it matches `manifest.json`. Falls back to the old hardcoded value only if the corner pixel is transparent or sampling fails.

**Notes**
- Found and fixed on `personal-sys-vps-private` (kro.uxprojects-jok.com) while deploying a real logo with a true `#000000` black background against the template's `#161513` charcoal default — ported here unchanged.

## [1.0.27] — 2026-07-17

**Fixed: the "How to update your node" runbook (`README.md`) didn't account for low-memory VPS deployments — `npm run generate` OOMs during the Vite client build on a 1-2GB node, since the WalletConnect dependency tree needs more heap than the default V8 limit allows.**

Hit live while updating karo-familie.de (1.8GB RAM, no swap configured) from v1.0.22 to v1.0.26: the client build crashed with "JavaScript heap out of memory" partway through bundling. Adding swap alone didn't fix it — V8's default `--max-old-space-size` is sized off *physical* RAM at process start, not swap-backed virtual memory, so the heap cap stayed low even with 2G of swap active. Both a swapfile (for physical backing) and an explicit raised heap limit (to actually make V8 use the extra room) are required together.

**Changed**
- `README.md` ("How to update your node"): added a low-memory VPS note between the rebuild step and the service-restart caveat, with the swapfile setup commands and the `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=3072 npm run generate` invocation.

## [1.0.26] — 2026-07-17

**Fixed: direct URL entry to the bare domain (`/`) on a locked single-hoster node showed the public "Save Your Soul." marketing landing with its own soul-file-upload login — completely unauthenticated and unrelated to `/gate`'s password/passkey login. A locked single-owner node has no legitimate use for this page (it belongs to the multi-hoster "anyone can join" case, where `/join` is the correct entry point).**

**Fixed**
- `app/pages/index.vue`: `onMounted()` now calls the existing no-auth `GET /api/gate-status` before deciding what to render. If the node is a locked single-hoster (`soul_registered && !multi_hoster`) and the visitor has no active local session, it silently redirects to `/gate` instead of ever rendering the marketing landing. A new `gateRedirectChecked` ref prevents the landing from flashing before the check resolves; the SPA-shell branch changed from a bare `v-else` to `v-else-if="hasSoul"` so it doesn't incorrectly render during that same window.
- Multi-hoster nodes are unaffected — the public landing + soul-upload/create flow remains the intended behavior there.

**Changed**
- `app/pages/gate.vue`: blank-landing logo enlarged again (120px → 220px) — needed more presence on the otherwise near-empty screen.

**Notes**
- Found, verified live, and ported from `personal-sys-vps-private` (kro.uxprojects-jok.com) — confirmed there by direct browser test with no active session.

## [1.0.25] — 2026-07-17

**Changed: the "SYS." wordmark on `/gate`, `/`, and `/join` is now the actual `logo.png` image instead of styled text — the text rendering didn't look good, and with the branding system from v1.0.24 already treating `logo.png` as the single source of truth, the wordmark itself should reflect whatever logo a node operator drops in, not a hardcoded "SYS" string.**

**Added**
- `app/components/SysMark.vue`: new component, `<img src="/logo.png" alt="SYS">` with a `size` prop (default `52px`, `/gate`'s blank landing uses `120px`). Centralizes the one place that needs editing for any future logo-related layout change, instead of three separate hardcoded blocks.

**Changed**
- `app/pages/gate.vue`, `index.vue`, `join.vue`: replaced `<div class="gate-mark">SYS<span class="dot">.</span></div>` with `<SysMark />` (Nuxt auto-imports it, same convention as `SysIcon`).
- `app/assets/css/sys-v2.css`: removed the now-unused `.gate-mark`/`.gate-mark .dot` text-styling rules (font, letter-spacing, dot color) — nothing renders that markup anymore.

**Notes**
- `alt="SYS"` kept as a fixed accessibility label, independent of the actual logo artwork — screen readers get a stable, meaningful name regardless of what a given node's `logo.png` looks like.
- Deliberately **not** ported to `personal-sys-vps-private` (kro) yet — kro has no `public/logo.png` of its own, and shipping this as-is there would show a broken image icon instead of the current working "SYS." text. Kro gets its own logo later; this stays public-repo-only until then.

## [1.0.24] — 2026-07-17

**Added: a single-source branding system — a node operator now only needs to replace three files in `public/` (`logo.png`, `logo.ico`, `favicon.ico`) to rebrand the entire app, including the PWA home-screen icons, which previously had to be regenerated by hand at fixed pixel sizes.**

Before this, `public/icons/icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png` were separate, independently-maintained files with no relationship to `logo.png`/`logo.ico` — swapping the logo files alone left the PWA install icon, Apple touch icon, and WalletConnect popup icon all showing the old artwork.

**Added**
- `utils/generate-icons.mjs`: regenerates `public/icons/icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png` from `public/logo.png` on every build. Uses a ~80% safe-zone with padding in the manifest's `background_color` (`#161513`), since `manifest.json` declares `purpose:"maskable any"` — content outside that inner zone can get clipped by an OS-applied circular/rounded mask. Skips silently (keeps existing icons) if `public/logo.png` isn't present, so a fresh clone without the file still builds.
- `package.json`: `build`/`generate` scripts now run `node utils/generate-icons.mjs` before `nuxt build`/`nuxt generate`, so the icons stay in sync automatically — no separate manual step for a node operator to remember.

**Changed**
- `public/logo.png`, `public/logo.ico`, `public/favicon.ico`: updated to the current SYS artwork (`favicon.ico` added as a redundant fallback — some browsers/crawlers probe `/favicon.ico` by convention regardless of the `<link rel="icon">` tag already pointing at `/logo.ico`, which stays primary).
- Removed unused legacy logo files: `public/logo/logo.png`, `public/logo/logo.ico` (an unreferenced duplicate folder), `public/logo_transparent.png` (unreferenced).

**Notes**
- The "SYS." wordmark shown throughout the UI (`/gate`, `/`, `/join`, etc.) is rendered as styled text (`.gate-mark`), not an image — swapping the logo files doesn't change it. A full rebrand still needs a separate text edit if the wordmark itself should change.
- `public/logo.png` is also referenced directly by the WalletConnect/AppKit popup (`useChainAnchor.js`) — that reference already just points at the static file path, so it updates automatically with no code change needed there.
- Fixed a bug caught during testing: an initial version of the script called `.resize()` twice in one `sharp` pipeline (once for the inner safe-zone, once "to be safe" after `.extend()`) — the second call silently overwrote the first's config instead of composing, producing 230×230/614×614 output instead of the requested 192×192/512×512. Removed the redundant second call; `sharp`'s `fit:'contain'` resize already guarantees the exact requested dimensions on its own.

## [1.0.23] — 2026-07-17

**Changed: redesigned `/gate` into a blank, unbranded landing screen — the login itself no longer draws any visual attention, since this URL can be linked externally (e.g. an imprint-law requirement) and shouldn't visibly read as a login/access point.**

Previously `/gate` always immediately showed either the biometric-unlock prompt or the password form, with a tagline and a "Local node" footer status line. Now the default view is just the centered "SYS." mark. A discreet, full-brightness (not dimmed — a low-opacity version proved hard to find even for the intended user) circular button in the top-right corner reveals the exact same existing login flow (biometric / password+cert form / save-credentials prompt — internal logic unchanged) as a smooth inline fade-in, no page navigation. A close (×) button lets the user return to the blank landing without a full reload.

**Changed**
- `app/pages/gate.vue`: new `revealed` ref gates the entire existing mode-driven login UI behind the discreet trigger button; added a `Transition` wrapper for the fade-in. Removed the tagline and footer status line entirely — no replacement text, the blank design itself communicates "not a public entry point" rather than a label. The "SYS." mark is significantly larger on this page only (scoped override, doesn't affect other pages using the same base class).
- `i18n/locales/{de,en}.json`: new `gate.owner_login_aria`/`gate.close_aria` strings, used only as the trigger/close buttons' accessible names and tooltips — never shown as visible body text.
- `public/manifest.json`: `start_url` changed from `/` to `/gate` — the installed PWA/home-screen icon was opening the *public* `index.vue` marketing landing (a separate page with its own soul-file-upload login), completely bypassing this redesigned entry point.

**Notes**
- `start_url` changes are typically only read at PWA *install* time — an already-installed home-screen icon likely needs to be removed and re-added for the new URL to take effect.
- `/` (`index.vue`) and `/gate` (`gate.vue`) remain two intentionally separate entry points with different purposes; this only changes which one the PWA shortcut opens by default.
- Found, iterated on, and verified live on `personal-sys-vps-private` (kro.uxprojects-jok.com), ported here with one adjustment: the private repo's version also always renders its Impressum/Datenschutz/Lizenz footer links regardless of login state (EU legal requirement specific to that node) — this generic template has no such pages, so that part was intentionally left out here.

## [1.0.22] — 2026-07-16

**Fixed: a Passkey newly registered through either Vault flow (Settings "Re-sync"/"Change Encryption", or the setup-wizard "Unlock Vault" panel) was never registered server-side for Fingerprint-Verify — so the next fingerprint verification attempt would ignore the working Vault passkey and register yet another new one, forcing an unnecessary extra biometric "save this passkey" prompt on the same device.**

**Fixed**
- `app/components/SettingsModal.vue`: new `verifyAuthHeaders()` helper, passed to both `authenticateOrRegister()` calls (Re-sync vault key, Change Encryption).
- `app/components/VaultSessionPanel.vue`: same helper added, passed to its `authenticateOrRegister()` call.

**Notes**
- `useSoulPasskey.js`'s `authenticateOrRegister()` already supported this via its second parameter — it just wasn't being used at these three call sites. Only takes effect for passkeys registered going forward.
- Found and verified on `personal-sys-vps-private` (kro.uxprojects-jok.com), ported here unchanged.

## [1.0.21] — 2026-07-16

**Fixed: newly registered passkeys are indistinguishable in the OS passkey manager (e.g. Windows Hello) when a user runs multiple SYS nodes on the same device — both `rp.name` and the default username were hardcoded identically across every node, so two entries both just showed "Soul" with no way to tell them apart.**

**Fixed**
- `app/composables/useSoulPasskey.js`: `registerPasskey()` now qualifies the WebAuthn `user.name`/`displayName` with the domain (`"{username} · {hostname}"`) instead of the bare, node-agnostic default.

**Notes**
- Only affects newly created passkeys going forward — WebAuthn has no rename operation, so already-registered credentials keep showing as plain "Soul" until deleted and re-registered.
- Found and verified on `personal-sys-vps-private` (kro.uxprojects-jok.com), ported here unchanged.

## [1.0.20] — 2026-07-16

**Fixed: fingerprint verification never pruned the local credential list after a successful match, unlike the vault-unlock flows — every attempt started from an unrestricted `authenticatePasskey()` call, so an OS with several accumulated resident credentials could keep returning an unregistered one, permanently re-triggering the self-heal path (fail → register new → re-auth, up to 3 biometric prompts) instead of ever converging on the working credential.**

**Fixed**
- `app/pages/verify.vue`: `doFingerprint()` now calls `pruneToCredentialId()` after every server-confirmed successful match — both the normal first-attempt path and the self-heal path.

**Notes**
- Found and verified on `personal-sys-vps-private` (kro.uxprojects-jok.com) via the `last_verified_at` tracking added one version earlier — confirmed two brand-new credentials were created within the same hour, each only seconds before its first successful verification, proving self-heal was firing on every attempt rather than being a one-time migration. Ported here unchanged.

## [1.0.19] — 2026-07-16

**Fixed: voice_hq verification always failed with "No security code found for this verification — please restart" when the verify challenge was created in open-choice mode (empty `methods[]`, user picks the method in the UI) and the user then chose Voice — regardless of whether an ElevenLabs API key was configured.**

**Fixed**
- `lua/verify_challenge.lua`: the server-side anti-replay `voice_code` was only pre-generated when `voice_hq` was explicitly listed in the challenge's `methods[]` at creation time — open-choice challenges never got a code, so choosing Voice there was doomed from the start. Now generated unconditionally on every challenge, matching how `webauthn_challenge` already handles the identical scenario for fingerprint.

**Notes**
- Found and verified on `personal-sys-vps-private` (kro.uxprojects-jok.com), ported here unchanged.

## [1.0.18] — 2026-07-16

**Added: `last_verified_at` tracking on passkey credentials, plus a small styling fix.**

**Added**
- `lua/verify_fingerprint_check.lua`: on every successful fingerprint verification, the matched credential's entry in `passkeys.json` now gets `last_verified_at` set (same timestamp format `created_at` already uses). Prerequisite for ever safely cleaning up accumulated stale credentials from repeated registration — without a "still in use" signal, deleting an apparently-orphaned entry risks locking out a device (e.g. a second phone) that's still using it.

**Changed**
- `app/components/SettingsModal.vue`: "Re-sync vault key" and "Change Encryption" buttons switched from ghost/outline to primary/filled style, matching the sibling "Rotate Soul-Cert" button.

**Notes**
- Found and verified on `personal-sys-vps-private` (kro.uxprojects-jok.com), ported here unchanged.

## [1.0.17] — 2026-07-16

**Added: an explicit, recorded vault-encryption method plus a safe way to change it — previously the vault key could be established via Passkey or a 12-word mnemonic with no record of which, and no supported way to migrate from one to the other short of manual file surgery.**

**Added**
- `lua/vault_unlock.lua`:
  - `POST /api/vault/unlock` accepts an optional `method` field (`"passkey"|"mnemonic"`), persisted as `vault_key_method`/`vault_key_set_at` in `api_context.json` — only on the *first* successful key establishment for a soul, never overwritten by a routine unlock that just re-proves an existing key.
  - `GET /api/vault/key-status` now also returns `vault_key_method` and `vault_key_set_at`.
  - New `POST /api/vault/rekey`: verifies `old_vault_key` against every encrypted file (reusing the existing mismatch-scan guard), then re-encrypts each file individually with `new_vault_key` and a fresh IV. Only persists the new key/method (and refreshes any active session/`webhook_token`) once every file has migrated — a partial failure leaves the old key fully intact and reports exactly which files didn't migrate.
- `server/openresty/vhost.conf.template`: new `location = /api/vault/rekey` block, same auth/rate-limit pattern as the sibling vault endpoints.
- `app/composables/useVaultSession.js`: `unlock()` gained a `method` parameter; new `rekey(oldKey, newKey, newMethod)`.
- `app/components/VaultSessionPanel.vue`: both unlock call sites pass `method`; added short tradeoff explanations for each method (Passkey: device-bound, may not sync across devices/managers; 12 words: portable but self-custody — no recovery if lost).
- `app/components/SettingsModal.vue`: Vault Key section shows the current method + when it was established; new "Change Encryption" flow (pick a new method, authenticate or generate+confirm-saved a new mnemonic, then migrate via `/api/vault/rekey`) mirroring the existing "Rotate Soul-Cert" flow.
- `i18n/locales/{de,en}.json`: new tradeoff/change-flow strings; `vault_session.method_warning` reworded to point at the new safe migration path.

**Notes**
- Found and verified on `personal-sys-vps-private` (kro.uxprojects-jok.com) with a full live round-trip against a real 10-file vault — unlock with method recorded, rekey to a new key/method, rekey back, and a wrong-key rekey attempt correctly rejected without touching any file — ported here unchanged.
- A normal unlock deliberately never changes the recorded method once a key exists — only `/api/vault/rekey` may change it, so the active method can't silently drift.

## [1.0.16] — 2026-07-16

**Fixed: the previous credential-pruning fix only covered the Settings "Vault Key" resync flow — `VaultSessionPanel.vue`'s own "Unlock Vault" button is a second, independent unlock entry point with the same stale-credential-list bug.**

**Changed**
- `app/components/VaultSessionPanel.vue`: `handleUnlock()` now prunes the local credential list after a successful passkey unlock, same as the Settings flow.
- `useVaultSession.js`: `unlock()`'s error handling now prefers the server's human-readable `message` field over the raw `error` code — the UI was showing the literal string `key_mismatch` instead of the actual explanation.

**Notes**
- Found on `personal-sys-vps-private` (kro.uxprojects-jok.com) immediately when testing this second unlock UI, ported here unchanged. Two independent entry points call the same unlock flow — worth remembering if a third is ever added.

## [1.0.15] — 2026-07-16

**Fixed: `PUT /api/context` (the write path behind the `soul_write` MCP tool) silently wrote `sys.md` in plaintext whenever the vault was locked, instead of rejecting the write.**

Root cause, in `lua/api_context.lua`'s `PUT` handler: the `else` branch's own comment said *"Open mode: Klartext nur wenn explizit cipher_mode=open gesetzt"* (plaintext only if cipher_mode is explicitly "open") — but the code never actually checked that. Any time `cipher_mode` was `"ciphered"` but no key happened to be available (vault locked), execution fell into the same plaintext branch the comment claimed was reserved for explicit open-mode operation.

**Changed**
- `lua/api_context.lua`: split the `else` branch — `cipher_mode == "ciphered"` with no key now returns `423 vault_locked` and refuses the write, instead of silently downgrading to plaintext.

**Notes**
- Found live on `personal-sys-vps-private` (kro.uxprojects-jok.com) — a `soul_write` call made while the vault happened to be locked silently overwrote `sys.md` back to plaintext, no error surfaced. Recovered there by re-encrypting the current content and restoring `vault_key_hex`. Ported here unchanged.
- Arguably the most important fix of the whole vault-encryption thread this session — earlier fixes protected secondary files from key mismatches, but this bug meant the primary soul content itself could silently lose its encryption on every write made while locked, an ongoing exposure path rather than a one-time artifact.

## [1.0.14] — 2026-07-16

**Fixed: "Vault Key: Re-sync" could report `key_mismatch` on the same device that had already worked correctly — a residual instance of the stale-credential-list problem, this time on the normal (non-self-heal) authentication path.**

`saveCredentialId()` only ever appends to the locally saved credential-ID list, never prunes. A *normal* `authenticatePasskey()` call still offers the entire accumulated list as `allowCredentials` — with several stale IDs on file, the OS/browser can satisfy the ceremony with any of them, not necessarily the one whose derived key matches the vault.

**Changed**
- `useSoulPasskey.js`: `authenticatePasskey()` now always records which credential was actually used in `lastUsedCredentialId`. New `pruneToCredentialId(id)` replaces the entire saved list with just one ID — only called when something external has confirmed that ID is correct.
- `SettingsModal.vue` (`handleResyncVaultKey`): after the server confirms a successful vault unlock, prunes the local list down to just that credential.

**Notes**
- Found on `personal-sys-vps-private` (kro.uxprojects-jok.com), ported here unchanged. Deliberately scoped to the vault-resync flow only, where a server response gives real confirmation.

## [1.0.13] — 2026-07-16

**Added: vault files that were never encrypted (e.g. context files seeded before the first vault key ever existed) now get encrypted automatically on unlock and on lock, not just left as plaintext indefinitely.**

Found on `personal-sys-vps-private`: `health.md`, `mind.md`, `earnings.md`, `agent.md` were still plaintext despite `cipher_mode: "ciphered"`, seeded during initial soul creation before any vault key existed. `POST /api/vault/lock` only ever removed the server's persisted key — it never protected files that were never encrypted, so "locked" gave a false sense of security for those files.

**Changed**
- `lua/vault_unlock.lua`: new `sweep_encrypt_plaintext()`, sharing its core logic with the existing `migrate_encrypt_generic_context.lua` (a manual, one-time CLI migration script), but wired in automatically on both `POST /api/vault/unlock` (after the mismatch-guard passes) and `POST /api/vault/lock` (using the key before it gets cleared). Excludes `sys.md` (client-driven encryption, out of scope here) and `shopping.md`/`prompts.md`/`ownagent.md` (always plaintext by design).
- Mismatch/sweep scanning switched from a hardcoded filename list to scanning `vault/context/` directly — also catches arbitrarily-named files written via `context_write`.
- `SettingsModal.vue`: distinguishes "vault locked, no key on file" from "wrong key present" instead of showing a false mismatch warning after a normal lock.

**Notes**
- Found on `personal-sys-vps-private` (kro.uxprojects-jok.com), verified end-to-end there. Ported here unchanged.

## [1.0.12] — 2026-07-16

**Fixed: `voice_hq` always showed "Security code not recognized" regardless of the actual failure reason, and there was no way to cancel out of the verify flow.**

Found during manual test runs on `personal-sys-vps-private`: the FFT voice match had succeeded, but the anti-replay digit check failed because no ElevenLabs API key was configured for the soul — the frontend showed the same generic message for a missing-API-key configuration problem as for a genuine wrong-digits case.

**Changed**
- `app/pages/verify.vue` (`doVoiceHq`): now distinguishes the server's actual failure reason (`elevenlabs_key_missing`, `no_voice_code_on_challenge`, service/network errors, or a genuine digit mismatch) and shows a specific message for each.
- Added a persistent close (×) button to the verify card, visible through every phase except initial load and the final "done" screen. Previously only the face-capture step had any way to back out of an in-progress verification.

**Notes**
- Found on `personal-sys-vps-private` (kro.uxprojects-jok.com), ported here unchanged. Doesn't configure an ElevenLabs key — that's an operator decision, this just makes the failure mode legible.

## [1.0.11] — 2026-07-16

**Fixed: v1.0.10's vault-key health-check/guard only covered `sys.md` — the real exposure was much broader.**

Scanning a real soul's vault against its current key found 3 more mismatched files the sys.md-only check had missed: a profile image, a voice recording, and `activity.md` (a write-activity log) — each encrypted with a different key from passkey churn. `activity_log.lua` was found to defensively refuse to write to a file it can't decrypt, meaning a mismatched `activity.md` gets silently, permanently stuck, not just wrong.

**Changed**
- `lua/vault_unlock.lua`: generalized the single-file check into `scan_vault_for_mismatches()`, covering `sys.md`, the server-encrypted context files (`health.md`, `mind.md`, `income.md`, `earnings.md`, `activity.md`, `agent.md`), and all vault media (`images/`, `audio/`, `video/`, `profile/`).
- Both `POST /api/vault/unlock`'s guard and `GET /api/vault/key-status` now use the full scan. Response shape changed to `{ checked, mismatched: [...], all_ok }`.
- `SettingsModal.vue`: Vault Key section now shows a checked/mismatched-file-count summary and lists which files don't match, and displays the raw `vault_key_hex` (like the Soul-Cert box) with a copy button.

**Fixed (found while extending the scan):**
- The check required non-empty decrypted output on top of trusting `resty.aes`'s nil-on-failure — broke on a genuinely empty but validly-encrypted file. A valid decrypt of empty plaintext is a 0-length string, not a failure.

**Notes**
- Found on `personal-sys-vps-private` (kro.uxprojects-jok.com), verified end-to-end there. Ported here unchanged.

## [1.0.10] — 2026-07-16

**Added: Vault Key health-check + manual re-sync in Settings → Config.** Previously there was no visible status for whether the server-persisted vault key actually matches `sys.md`, and no way to fix a mismatch short of the initial setup wizard — a mismatch only surfaced as a cryptic "vault locked" error on the next `soul_read`.

**Added**
- `GET /api/vault/key-status` (`lua/vault_unlock.lua`, new route in `vhost.conf.template`): reports whether the currently persisted `vault_key_hex` actually decrypts the soul's `sys.md` — the same check now guarding `POST /api/vault/unlock`, exposed as a read-only health-check.
- `SettingsModal.vue` → Config tab, new "Vault Key" section: shows the health-check result and a "Re-sync vault key" button reusing the existing passkey → `authenticateOrRegister()` → `deriveVaultKeyHex()` → `unlock()` flow — reachable without going through `SoulSetupWizard.vue`, previously the *only* place it was wired up.

**Fixed (found while building the above):**
- `key_matches_sys_md()`'s classic Lua `and/or` ternary breaks when the true-branch value is itself `false` — collapses to the false-branch instead, hiding a real mismatch. Replaced with an explicit `if`.
- `key_matches_sys_md()` re-validated PKCS7 padding manually on top of `resty.aes`'s decrypt output, which already strips padding internally and returns `nil` on a bad key (same as `api_serve.lua`'s proven `try_decrypt()`). The manual re-check produced false negatives for correct keys.

**Notes**
- Found on `personal-sys-vps-private` (kro.uxprojects-jok.com), verified end-to-end against real data there. Ported here unchanged.

## [1.0.9] — 2026-07-16

**Fixed: "Save with biometrics" still failed after an OS-level passkey deletion — a third independently-stale piece of local state, on top of v1.0.8.**

`useSoulPasskey.js`'s own `hasPasskey` ref, backed by a separate `localStorage` key (`sys_passkey_credential_ids`), also survives an OS-level passkey deletion untouched — every call site using the `hasPasskey.value ? authenticatePasskey() : registerPasskey()` pattern kept trying to authenticate against a deleted credential instead of registering a new one, with no fallback.

**Changed**
- `useSoulPasskey.js`: new `authenticateOrRegister(username, getAuthHeaders)` — tries authenticate first if `hasPasskey` is true, but on failure clears the stale local credential-ID list and falls back to registration. `getEncryptKey()` uses it internally too.
- `gate.vue` (`doSaveCreds`), `VaultSessionPanel.vue`: switched to `authenticateOrRegister()`.

**Notes**
- Found on `personal-sys-vps-private` (kro.uxprojects-jok.com). Audited the rest of `app/` for the same pattern — these were the only two call sites. Ported here unchanged.

## [1.0.8] — 2026-07-16

**Fixed: deleting a passkey outside the app (OS/Google Password Manager) permanently stopped the app from ever offering to register a new one.**

Root cause: `useSavedCreds.js`'s `hasCreds` (an encrypted password+cert blob in `localStorage`) is what `submit()` checks to decide whether to show the "save with biometric" step. This blob has no relationship to whether the underlying passkey still exists on the device — it survives an OS-level passkey deletion untouched, so the app kept assuming a working passkey existed indefinitely.

**Changed**
- `app/pages/gate.vue`: `biometricUnlock()`'s auth-failure branch now clears the stale `hasCreds` blob and drops to the manual login form instead of just showing an error and stopping.

**Notes**
- Found on `personal-sys-vps-private` (kro.uxprojects-jok.com) via a user who deleted all their passkeys and got permanently stuck with no way to be re-offered registration. Ported here unchanged.
- Doesn't retroactively fix an already-stuck browser session — the stale blob only clears the next time `biometricUnlock()` runs and fails.

## [1.0.7] — 2026-07-16

**Fixed: the fingerprint self-heal could still fail with `unknown_credential` — the re-verify step could authenticate with the wrong local passkey.**

Root cause: `authenticatePasskey()` (in `useSoulPasskey.js`) built its WebAuthn `allowCredentials` list from every locally saved credential ID, not just the one just created. Because passkey creation uses `residentKey: 'preferred'`, each repeated self-heal registration created a new, identically-named ("Soul") discoverable credential in the platform keychain. With multiple matching credentials offered, the OS/browser can satisfy the WebAuthn `get()` call with any of them, not necessarily the one that was just registered — landing back on `unknown_credential` if it picks an older, differently-registered one.

**Changed**
- `useSoulPasskey.js`: `registerPasskey()` now exposes `lastRegisteredCredentialId`. `authenticatePasskey()` gained an optional second parameter to restrict `allowCredentials` to exactly one ID instead of all saved ones.
- `app/pages/verify.vue`: the self-heal's re-verify step now passes `lastRegisteredCredentialId.value`, forcing the browser to use precisely the credential that was just registered.

**Notes**
- Found on `personal-sys-vps-private` (kro.uxprojects-jok.com), 7 stray credentials had accumulated for one soul before this fix. Doesn't clean those up (lives in the browser/OS keychain, not server-reachable) — harmless clutter, future self-heal runs work correctly regardless. Ported here unchanged.

## [1.0.6] — 2026-07-16

**Fixed: fingerprint's passkey self-heal (added in v1.0.2) registered a new passkey but never proved it, so the server kept rejecting the method.**

Root cause: the self-heal path (`app/pages/verify.vue`) registered a fresh passkey after a `no_passkey_registered`/`unknown_credential` failure, then reported success directly — treating "I could call `navigator.credentials.create()`" as proof. But `verify_complete.lua`'s guard only trusts `d.fingerprint_verified`, set exclusively by a real signature check in `verify_fingerprint_check.lua`. The self-heal never performed that second step, so the server silently rejected the method every time despite the client reporting success.

**Changed**
- `app/pages/verify.vue`: after a successful self-heal registration, immediately sign the current challenge with the new credential and call `/api/verify/fingerprint-check` again for real — `ok` is now decided by that actual signature check, not registration success alone.

**Notes**
- Found on `personal-sys-vps-private` (kro.uxprojects-jok.com): `passkeys.json` had accumulated 6 distinct newly-created credentials across separate attempts, `completed_methods` never contained `"fingerprint"` despite three separate real sessions. Ported here unchanged.

## [1.0.5] — 2026-07-16

**Fixed: verification score not accumulating across multiple methods completed on the same challenge outside the pre-selected multi-method flow.**

`verify_complete.lua` has two flows: a multi-method flow (used when the challenge was created with `required_methods`, or the frontend sent `selected_methods` with >1 entries) that correctly accumulates `completed_methods`/`score`, and a single-method flow for the simple case. The single-method flow both (a) rejected any further `/complete` call once the challenge reached `status="verified"` (`409 already_completed`), and — more importantly — (b) when it did run, overwrote `d.completed_methods`/`d.score` with just the current method instead of adding to what was already there. A user completing fingerprint, then separately completing face on the same challenge would see the UI's client-side method list correctly show both as done, but the server-reported score reset to the last method's weight alone.

**Changed**
- `lua/verify_complete.lua`: single-method flow now accumulates onto `completed_methods`/`score` like the multi-method flow does, and no longer hard-rejects once `status="verified"` — each additional, individually-proven method (duplicates still rejected by the existing check) adds to the running total instead of replacing it.

**Notes**
- Found on `personal-sys-vps-private` (kro.uxprojects-jok.com) via a user report showing "Fingerprint +1 / Facial recognition +1 / ... Score 1". Ported here unchanged.
- Does not merge scores across genuinely separate challenge_id's — only fixes accumulation within one challenge's lifetime.

## [1.0.4] — 2026-07-16

**Fixed: a second, distinct soul-mcp crash mechanism that survived the v1.0.3 fix.**

After deploying v1.0.3's `unhandledRejection` handler on the node this was found on, the process crashed once more a couple minutes later — a genuinely different failure: `Error: Unexpected server response: 429` from the `ws` library, meaning the WebSocket *handshake itself* was rejected (HTTP 429) before any JSON-RPC exchange even happened. `ws` emits this as a synchronous `'error'` event on the WebSocket instance, and `soul_indexer.mjs`'s `subscribeWs()` only ever listened for `'close'`, never `'error'` — Node's rule is that an emitted `'error'` event with zero listeners throws and kills the process (a different code path from unhandled promise rejections; `unhandledRejection` cannot catch it).

**Changed**
- `soul_indexer.mjs`: added an `'error'` listener on `_ws.websocket` (logs only — reconnect is already scheduled by the paired `'close'` event for the same failure, `ws`'s `emitErrorAndClose()` fires both; a second reconnect scheduled here would race it).
- `soul_indexer.mjs`: the historical `eth_getLogs` backfill's archive-error path (`Block-Range-Fehler`) was `continue`-ing past the `SCAN_DELAY_MS` pacing sleep entirely — for a block range mostly beyond the public RPC's archive window, the backfill hammered the same public endpoint the WebSocket subscription depends on with effectively no pacing on that path. Moved the sleep to run before the `continue` too. Plausible (not proven) contributing cause of the rate-limit errors in the first place.

**Notes**
- Found on `personal-sys-vps-private` (kro.uxprojects-jok.com) immediately after deploying v1.0.3 there — checked logs specifically because that fix should have stopped restarts, and instead a different stack trace showed up. Ported here unchanged.

## [1.0.3] — 2026-07-16

**Fixed: `soul-mcp` crash-looping (systemd restart counter at 90+ on the node this was found on), taking down every MCP tool for the whole node repeatedly.**

Root cause: `soul_indexer.mjs`'s `subscribeWs()` sets up a live WebSocket subscription to the Polygon soul-registry contract via `ethers.WebSocketProvider`. When the public RPC (`polygon-bor-rpc.publicnode.com`) rate-limits the `eth_subscribe` call (`-32005 Rate limit exceeded`), ethers rejects a promise deep inside its own subscription-management code that nothing in this codebase awaits or catches — Node's default `unhandledRejection` behavior then kills the entire process. Since soul-mcp is one process serving all MCP tools, every crash took down `verify_identity`, `soul_read`, peer messaging, everything, for however long the ~15s reconnect + systemd restart took.

**Changed**
- `soul-mcp/server.mjs`: added a process-level `unhandledRejection` handler — logs and keeps running instead of crashing.

**Notes**
- Found and fixed first on `personal-sys-vps-private` (kro.uxprojects-jok.com), confirmed via `journalctl -u soul-mcp` — crashes recurring roughly every ~12 minutes, restart counter had reached 90. Ported here unchanged, no private-specific content in the touched lines.
- Separate, lower-severity observation not fixed here: `soul_indexer.mjs`'s historical `eth_getLogs` scan logs a `Block-Range-Fehler ... Chunk übersprungen` warning per 90-block chunk once it hits the public RPC's archive-data limit — expected behavior for a non-archive public RPC (scan still makes forward progress, no crash, no data loss), just noisy at `warn` level.

## [1.0.2] — 2026-07-16

**Fixed: `verify_identity` fingerprint check failing despite a working passkey ("Biometrie Fingerabdruck fehlt").**

Root cause: two independent passkey-registration call sites, only one of which registers the public key server-side.
- `gate.vue`'s initial "save credentials with biometric unlock" step calls `registerPasskey('Soul')` with no `getAuthHeaders` — by design this skips the server-side `/api/verify/passkey-register` call ("best effort", see `useSoulPasskey.js` comment). The WebAuthn credential is created and works fine for gate unlock (purely client-side), but the server never learns the public key.
- `verify.vue`'s fingerprint check already had a self-heal path that re-registers the passkey on failure — but only for `reason === 'unknown_credential'` (passkeys.json exists, this credential isn't in it), not for `reason === 'no_passkey_registered'` (passkeys.json doesn't exist at all) — which is exactly what a gate-only-registered passkey produces. Souls that only ever went through `gate.vue` hit the uncovered case and got a hard failure instead of self-healing.

**Changed**
- `app/pages/verify.vue`: self-heal condition now also covers `no_passkey_registered`, not just `unknown_credential` — re-registers automatically on next fingerprint verification attempt, no user action beyond retrying needed.
- `app/pages/gate.vue`: `doSaveCreds()` now passes `getAuthHeaders` to `registerPasskey('Soul', ...)`, using the just-confirmed `${currentSoulId}.${cert}` bearer — new passkeys register server-side from the start, so this doesn't recur for newly onboarded souls.

**Notes**
- Found and fixed first on `personal-sys-vps-private` (kro.uxprojects-jok.com), confirmed by checking `/var/lib/sys/souls/{soul_id}/passkeys.json` directly on that node — file didn't exist at all. Ported here unchanged since neither file has any private-specific content.

## [1.0.1] — 2026-07-16

**Fixed**
- Health Sync / Garmin login was completely non-functional: OpenResty's worker
  (`www-data`) has no write access to `/var/log` (`root:syslog`, mode 775), so
  the backgrounded `garmin_login.py` process silently failed to even start.
  The UI then always hit its 25s timeout and showed a misleading "enter MFA
  code" prompt, even though Garmin was never actually contacted and no SMS
  was ever sent.
- `cryptography` was missing from the health-sync venv (`vault_crypto.py`
  needs it to decrypt stored Garmin credentials) — added to both installers'
  `pip install` step.

**Changed**
- Health-sync log writes repointed from `/var/log/sys_health_sync.log` to
  `/var/log/sys/health_sync.log` — a dedicated, `www-data`-writable directory.
  `sys-installer`'s `init.sh` now creates this directory during core install;
  `setup_server.sh` / `install.sh` create it defensively too.

**Migration required**
- Nodes that ran Health Sync setup *before* this release won't self-heal —
  the directory/dependency fixes only apply on (re-)run of `setup_server.sh`
  or `install.sh`. On an already-running node, apply manually:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p /var/log/sys && chown www-data:www-data /var/log/sys && chmod 750 /var/log/sys
  /opt/sys/health-sync/.venv/bin/pip install -q cryptography
  ```

- Integrity fingerprint for this tag: `d3edd4a4be7bbaf0` (`node utils/project-hash.mjs`).

---

## [1.0.0] — 2026-07-16

First tagged release. Marks the baseline for the current two-node production split:

- `kro.uxprojects-jok.com` — Personal Node, deployed from the private full-feature repo (`personal-sys-vps-private`).
- `karo-familie.de` — Multi-Hoster Node, deployed from this repo (`personal-sys-vps`) + `sys-installer`.

**Added**
- Update strategy documentation in `README.md` ("Updating Your Node"): tagged-release process, protocol-vs-implementation compatibility guarantee, convention for keeping operator-specific customizations safe across updates, version/fingerprint verification.
- This `CHANGELOG.md`.

**Notes**
- No migration required — this release only adds documentation and process, no code/schema changes relative to the prior untagged state both live nodes were already running.
- Integrity fingerprint for this tag: `1b2f589a68e36f67` (`node utils/project-hash.mjs`).
